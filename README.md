# Python Basics

## Description
This is a simple Python script that demonstrates basic concepts such as:
- File handling (writing and reading from a file)
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) with a `Person` class
- User interaction through input and output
- A basic number guessing game using random numbers

## Features
- **Person Class**: Creates a person with a name and age and greets the user.
- **File Handling**: Writes a message to a file and reads it back.
- **Number Guessing Game**: Allows the user to guess a random number between 1 and 10 with three attempts.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3 recommended).
2. Save the script as `main.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt in the script's directory.
4. Run the script using:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Output
```
Hello, my name is John and I am 25 years old.
Message written to example.txt
Reading from file:
Hello, this is a test message!
Guess a number between 1 and 10.
Enter your guess: 5
Too low. Try again.
Enter your guess: 7
Congratulations! You guessed correctly.
```
